		          <p>It's efforts of <a href="http://mttmccb.net/">@mttmccb</a> to give back to the app.net community, there's a lot of apps that focus on posts but not enough that focus on profiles. This will probably morph into some sort of profile explorer but there's a lot of work still to do.</p>	
		          <p>It's been built using <a href="http://aurelia.io">aurelia</a> which may not be a great idea as it's still quite new, but so far it has been really enjoyable and the output is not too bad. Under the hood it's using <a href="http://purecss.io">Pure.CSS</a> which is very minimal (unlike the JavaScript!) and does most of what is needed right now. If you're interested in the dependencies then had a look on <a href="https://github.com/mttmccb/dark_social">GitHub</a>.</p>
                
              <p>Here's hoping you find Dark.Social useful, if you spot anything out of place or can think of ways to improve it then please <a href="https://github.com/mttmccb/dark_social/issues/new">raise an issue</a>.</p>
